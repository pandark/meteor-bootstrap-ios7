Meteor Bootstrap-iOS7
==================

[Bootstrap iOS7](http://jasonbradley.me/bootstrap-ios7/) packaged for
[Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Almost everything that doesn't come from bootstrap-ios7 comes from
[mizzao:meteor-bootstrap-3](https://github.com/mizzao/meteor-bootstrap-3).

### Installation

With Meteor 1.0 and above, install using:

```sh
$ meteor add pandark:bootstrap-ios7
```

### Building

The package can't be built easily at the moment. There are some problems with
bootstrap-ios7's dependencies.
